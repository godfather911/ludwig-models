# Ludwig Models

This repository contains a number of different models implemented in [Ludwig](https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/):

The [official models](official) are a collection of example models described in the [Ludwig examples](https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/examples/). They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the latest stable Ludwig API. They should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read. We especially recommend newer Ludwig users to start here.

The [research models](research) are a large collection of models implemented in Ludwig by researchers. They are not officially supported or available in release branches; it is up to the individual researchers to maintain the models and/or provide support on issues and pull requests.

The [samples folder](samples) contains code snippets and smaller models that demonstrate features of Ludwig, including code presented in various blog posts.
